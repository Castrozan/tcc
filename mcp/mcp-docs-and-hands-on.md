# MCP Docs and Hands-On

- [x] **Understand the Fundamentals**

  - [x] Read the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and core concepts.
  - [x] Study how MCP enables LLMs to interact with external data (tools, resources, prompts).
  - [x] Review use case examples (e.g., filesystem access, weather servers, coding assistants).

- [x] **Set Up Your Environment**

  - [x] Download and install the latest Claude Desktop. [.dotfiles](https://github.com/Castrozan/.dotfiles/commit/a7c9a29c668ed2053edf7cd32593c2de12da7ca1)
  - [x] Familiarize yourself with the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
  - [x] Set up version control for Claude config using `make apply-claude-config`
  - [x] Install required tools (e.g., Node.js, npm, and optionally uv for Python projects).

- [x] **Follow Tutorials & Guides**

  - [x] Complete step-by-step guides (e.g., "For Claude Desktop Users" on the MCP website).
  - [x] Watch tutorials (e.g., YouTube videos like "Create Your First MCP Server").
  - [x] Explore community resources (Reddit threads, GitHub projects like codemcp).

- [x] **Hands-On Practice**

  - [x] Set up a basic MCP server (e.g., the filesystem server).
  - [x] Modify the `claude_desktop_config.json` to include your MCP server.
  - [x] [Test](https://claude.ai/share/42452600-1418-4d54-a1c3-ef13ba04a501) and debug your MCP server using Claude (check logs and troubleshoot as needed).

- [ ] **Explore Advanced Topics**

  - [ ] Experiment with building your own custom MCP servers (e.g., a coding assistant or API integration tool).
  - [ ] Learn advanced integration techniques (passing environment variables, using WSL on Windows).
  - [ ] Review and study source code from repositories like [codemcp](https://github.com/ezyang/codemcp).

- [ ] **Engage with the Community**

  - [ ] Join communities (e.g., [r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/)) to discuss MCP and Claude Desktop.
  - [ ] Ask questions and share your experiences.
  - [ ] Follow updates and subscribe to newsletters or blogs from Anthropic and other developers.

- [ ] **Document Your Learning**
  - [ ] Keep a journal detailing your experiments, configuration changes, and troubleshooting tips.
  - [ ] Consider sharing your projects and learnings (e.g., blog posts or GitHub contributions).
