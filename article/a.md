Read the article. Make review of the full article.

After this, we will tackle this comment in the MATERIAIS section.

Make sure to understand and note what the comment is talking about and why it needs change.
With this we need to create a plan to implement this changes.

You should plan all the sections and paragraphs that need change pointing each phrases intention that need change or need to be added.

After you create the plan. Review it again to make sure it is valid for the context of this academic article in portuguese standards. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, you can do these changes. follow your plan in sequence. Focus on each step and after finishing every step go back and do another review and fix if necessary

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We don't need. One part o the article is making the breakthrough that is possible to do what we did and this is the proof of concept, if it works thats the proof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take in consideration the writing cohesion and all rules of writing for portuguese. 

Do you think is best on a academic article to leave the objectives as bullet points like this? 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK, lets work on the improovments that you found and fix the inconsistances.

I will not make new tests or implementations, so make the disclaimers and change the affirmations as well as not be 100% sure on the metrics. But let it be clear that this is proof of possibility of great advances easyer of integration of systems to LLMs.


Im definir clealy the objectives to be what ive implemented but i think the objectives should be more broad to mention the aim to a easyer integration between systems and LLM to reach a agent like interaction and mcp and openapi is a good solution. 


With all this in mind, create a plan to introduce and fix the problems you and i noted.

IMPORTANT: do no write text just review and create the plan
