Lets work on this article academic presentation. I will present the article to a select group of professors that will judge the work done in it.

In the @presentation.md we have the pre-planned presentation and in the @guidelines.md we have a bunch of guidelines for the presentation.

The presentation will be a PowerPoint slide presentation. 

For now i need you to understand deeply the article and the presentation requirements. So take a good look into it. Reason about it. Once you have figured out, ask yourself what you've understood of the article and then come back to me with a full review of the article and the planning of the presentation and it's guidelines

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, lets focus firstly on applying the presentation editor guidelines to the plan that is already defined. Go through each slide definition and apply the guidelines.

Slides that do not have enough information already set in the plan to fill all required fields should remain empty, afterward we are gonna go through every slide reviewing the content and speech that should be presented.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, great. Now lets work on slide: 2

Go through the article again in the section related to this slide and read it again. After reading and understanding its purpose, adjust the slide definition to better suit the objectives of the presentation and the guidelines.

Slides that should have a image should not have bullet points, only the image

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great, lets just add the references in the ABNT style to the bullet points related to what should be said so it has the correct theoretical embasement. Get the citations in the article file for the current section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Again, we need any references in this slide? we may not need, figure out if is needed and which based on the article.
