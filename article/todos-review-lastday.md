## HIGH PRIORITY TODOS

### 1. Documentation and Technical Details Enhancement

#### 1.1 Add Missing Technical Details
**Context from review**: "Some implementation specifics are unclear or omitted"
**Author input**: "I have all the code and implementation so what can be shown?"

**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Add code snippet showing the MCP server generation process in Section 3.3
- [x] Include the core algorithm for OpenAPI parsing and conversion
- [x] Show the TypeScript interface definitions for MCP tools
- [ ] Add diagram showing the data flow through the three-layer architecture
- [x] Include configuration examples for multi-server setup

**Suggested locations**:
- After paragraph introducing the three-layer architecture in Section 3.3
- In Section 3.4 when discussing multi-server coordination

#### 1.2 Add Concrete Code Examples
**Context from review**: "Would benefit from more concrete implementation examples"
**Author input**: "which parts of the code and where in the article should i present it?"

**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Add example of OpenAPI spec conversion to MCP tool (before/after) (mcp-openapi-server/src/openapi-loader.ts) (add a print of the generator logs when all tools are generated)
- [x] Include example of function calling integration with GPT-4 (chat-client/backend/modules/conversation-manager.js)
- [x] Show example of error handling in the routing layer (mcp-openapi-server/src/api-client.ts)

**Suggested locations**:
- Section 3.3: OpenAPI to MCP conversion example
- Section 3.5: Function calling example with actual prompts and responses

#### 1.3 Describe Dataset Characteristics
**Context from review**: "Insufficient description of test data and scenarios used"
**Author input**: "How should i present this and where?"

**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Create a new subsection 3.5.1 "Test Dataset Specification" (chat-client/tests/user-experience/ux.spec.js , chat-client/tests/security/security.spec.js, chat-client/tests/performance/performance.spec.js)
- [x] Add table with test scenarios details:
  - Number of test cases per category 
  - Types of operations tested
  - Example queries used
  - Expected vs actual responses
- [ ] Include examples of the 13 test scenarios mentioned
- [ ] Document the security test payloads used (chat-client/tests/security/security.spec.js)
- [ ] Describe the equipment and HR system schemas used in testing (equipments-dummy-app/src/presentation/controllers/equipments/, professionals-dummy-app/src/presentation/controllers/professionals/)

**Format suggestion**:
```
Table X: Test Dataset Characteristics
| Test Category   | Scenarios | Example Query             | Expected Behavior       |
| --------------- | --------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| CRUD Operations | 4         | "Create new equipment..." | Successfully creates... |
```

### 2. Scope Clarification Throughout Article

#### 2.1 Limited Experimental Scope
**Author input**: "make it clear to the reader that there's a lot of space for more research and this article is a proof of concept"

**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Add paragraph in Introduction acknowledging proof-of-concept scope
- [x] Modify Section 2 introduction to emphasize preliminary validation
- [x] Add clarification in Results section about scope limitations
- [x] Strengthen "Future Work" mentions throughout

**Specific text additions needed**:
- Introduction: "Este estudo constitui uma validação inicial..."
- Methods: "Dentro do escopo experimental definido..."
- Results: "Os resultados, embora promissores, refletem..."

#### 2.2 Performance Concerns Acknowledgment
**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Add clarification in Section 4.1 about the performance concerns and scope of the experiment
- [x] Acknowledge the 336% variance as expected in proof-of-concept
- [x] Mention optimization as future work opportunity
- [x] Reference potential caching strategies without implementing

#### 2.3 Security Assessment Scope
**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Add disclaimer in Section 4.4 about basic attack coverage (most of llms already have features to mitigate these attacks, but more research is needed for more advanced attacks) (chat-client/tests/security/security.spec.js)
- [ ] List advanced threats as future research opportunities
- [ ] Acknowledge enterprise requirements for production

### 3. Technical Clarifications

#### 3.1 Error Propagation Discussion
**Author input**: "When errors occur in the base layers, the LLM has access to every tool's full response so it can reason about the error and try to fix it"

**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Add subsection 3.3.1 "Tratamento de Erros e Recuperação"
- [x] Explain how LLM receives full API responses
- [x] Describe self-healing capabilities through retry logic
- [x] Include example of error handling flow

**Content to add**:
"Quando erros ocorrem nas camadas base, o LLM tem acesso completo à resposta da ferramenta original da API, permitindo que o modelo interprete o contexto do erro e tente estratégias alternativas de forma autônoma..."

#### 3.2 Performance Optimization Mention
**Author input**: "The architecture has potential for server generation cache, but i think the target application is the one that should handle the cache as it has the most knowledge about the data and the most control over it"

**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Add comment in 3.3 mentioning caching potential
- [x] Note that request caching may be a concern for the target application
- [x] Position as future research opportunity

### 4. Writing Improvements

#### 4.1 Technical Terms Clarification
**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Create glossary box for terms: MCP, OpenAPI, Function Calling, LLM, Prompt Injection
- [ ] Add brief explanations when terms first appear
- [ ] Use footnotes for complex technical concepts

**Terms needing definition**:
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) - first mention
- Function calling - when discussing GPT-4 capabilities
- Red teaming - in security context
- Prompt injection vs jailbreak - distinguish clearly

#### 4.2 Simplify Dense Sections
**TODO Actions**:
- [ ] Simplify the three-layer architecture explanation
- [ ] Add more transitional sentences between concepts

**Sections to simplify**:
- [x] Section 2.2.2 - Evaluation criteria
- [x] Section 3.1.1 - Architecture description (add diagram)

#### 4.3 Make Conclusion More Concise
**TODO Actions**:
- [x] Reduce conclusion from 6 subsections to 4
- [x] Combine 5.1 and 5.2 into single "Principais Contribuições"
- [x] Merge limitations into future work discussion
- [x] Create punchy final paragraph (max 100 words)

**New structure**:
1. Principais Contribuições e Resposta à Pergunta de Pesquisa
2. Limitações e Trabalhos Futuros
3. Implicações Práticas
4. Conclusão Final (concisa)

### 5. Future Work Section Enhancement

**TODO Actions**:
- [ ] Create dedicated Section 5.2 "Direções para Pesquisas Futuras"
- [x] List all mentioned limitations as research opportunities
- [ ] Be explicit about proof-of-concept boundaries
- [ ] Add statement: "Este trabalho estabelece as bases para..."

**Topics to include as future work**:
- Performance optimization and caching strategies
- Advanced security threat mitigation
- Scalability to hundreds of concurrent servers
- Comparative studies with other integration approaches
- Real user studies and enterprise deployment patterns
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Support for GraphQL and other API specifications

## Key Messages to Maintain Throughout

1. **This is a proof of concept** - successful initial validation
2. **Limitations are acknowledged** - and represent future opportunities
3. **Technical viability is demonstrated** - within tested scope
4. **Foundation for future work** - not comprehensive solution

## Success Criteria

- [x] All technical details requests addressed with code/examples
- [x] Scope limitations clearly stated in each major section
- [ ] Dense sections simplified without losing technical accuracy
- [x] Conclusion reduced by at least 30% in length
- [x] Future work section explicitly lists all mentioned limitations
- [x] Reader clearly understands this is initial validation, not final solution
