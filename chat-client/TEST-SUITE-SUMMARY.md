### Configuration Files
```
playwright.config.js             # Optimized Playwright settings
package.json                     # NPM scripts and dependencies
.env                            # Environment configuration
```

## 🔧 Technical Optimizations

### 1. **Playwright Configuration**
```javascript
// Key optimizations applied:
fullyParallel: false            // Prevents conflicts
workers: 1                      // Single worker for consistency
actionTimeout: 30000           // Optimized from 120s
navigationTimeout: 30000       // Balanced performance
reporter: 'line'               // Faster feedback
```

### 2. **Test Execution Strategy**
```javascript
// Optimized patterns:
- Reduced timeouts from 120s to 30-45s
- Single worker execution (no parallel conflicts)
- Efficient waiting strategies
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Streamlined query sets
```

### 3. **Metrics Collection**
```javascript
// Comprehensive data capture:
- Response times with millisecond precision
- Success/failure rates with detailed tracking
- Security vulnerability assessment
- UX quality scoring (5-point scale)
- Consistency measurements
- Error categorization and reporting
```
