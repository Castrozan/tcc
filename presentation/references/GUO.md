Abstract and Figures
Conversational agents have gained increasing popularity over the last decade in a variety of personal, public, and occupational settings due to rapid advances of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). However, how users can interact with such technologies is still understudied. The objective of this study was to investigate type of conversation (presence and absence of continuous conversation) and task complexity (high vs. low) on usability metrics (i.e., task completion time, number of queries used in completing tasks, and perceived system usability) with conversational agents in smart home environments. Eighteen participants joined this study and completed required tasks. The results showed that there was a significant effect of type of conversation on task completion time and number of queries per task. Task complexity significantly extended task completion time and increased number of queries per task. The results may help with the design of more usable conversational agents.
