Lets work on this article academic presentation. I will present the article to a select group of professors that will judge the work done in it.

In the @presentation.md we have the pre-planned presentation and in the @guidelines.md we have a bunch of guidelines for the presentation.

The presentation will be a PowerPoint slide presentation. 

For now i need you to undestand profundly the article and the presentation requirements. So take a good look into it. Reason about it. Once you have figgured out, ask yourself what you've understanded of the article and then come back to me with a full review of the article and the planning of the presentation and it's guidelines

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, lets focus firstly on applying the presentation editor guidelines to the plan that is already defined. Go through each slide definition and apply the guidelines.

Slides that do not have enough information already set in the plan to fill all required fields should remain empty, aftewars we are gonna go through every slide reviewing the content and speech that shoudl be presented.
