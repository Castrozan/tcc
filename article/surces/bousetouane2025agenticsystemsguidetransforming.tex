\section{Introduction}
The rapid evolution of technology has transformed business operations, with SaaS platforms \cite{AIforITOps2023} becoming essential for scalability and efficiency across industries. However, as industries face increasingly dynamic and complex environments, traditional SaaS solutions often fall short in meeting domain-specific and evolving needs.

To bridge this gap, \textbf{agentic systems} have emerged as a new generation of solutions. Powered by LLMs and advanced AI capabilities, they deliver intelligent, context-driven, and domain-specific solutions, addressing the limitations of both traditional SaaS platforms and context-aware systems.



\subsection{The Shortcomings of Traditional SaaS Platforms}
Traditional SaaS platforms serve as the backbone of business operations, offering reliable tools for managing workflows and maintaining operational consistency. Their architecture emphasizes horizontal scalability and general applicability, enabling businesses to standardize processes and optimize routine tasks across industries. This broad applicability makes SaaS ideal for managing repetitive tasks and scaling operations across diverse sectors. However, this generalized design often comes at the expense of domain-specific intelligence and flexibility, which are critical for addressing the unique challenges of dynamic and complex environments.

These limitations are evident in various industries:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{E-commerce:} Platforms efficiently handle online transactions, product catalog management, and order tracking. Yet, they often require extensive customization to analyze customer purchasing behaviors, predict seasonal demand trends, or dynamically adjust inventory levels based on real-time sales data.
    \item \textbf{Multichannel Marketing:} Tools streamline campaign management across various channels, offering templates and automation for email, social media, and advertisements. However, their reliance on predefined workflows limits their ability to adapt quickly to shifting customer preferences, emerging trends, or competitor strategies.

\newpage
    \item \textbf{Inventory Management:} Systems track stock levels and trigger reorders based on predefined thresholds. Despite this, they typically lack the ability to anticipate supply chain disruptions, respond to sudden demand spikes, or optimize procurement strategies using external market insights.
\end{itemize}

These examples underscore the reliance of traditional SaaS platforms on rule-based automation and structured data inputs. While effective for predictable and routine processes, they fall short in addressing domain-specific tasks that require contextual intelligence and adaptability.

\subsection{The Transition to Context-Aware Systems}
The limitations of traditional SaaS platforms have driven the adoption of \textbf{context-aware systems}, which aim to address these gaps by integrating real-time data and adaptability into workflows. By dynamically adjusting to evolving scenarios, these systems enable businesses to operate more effectively in increasingly complex environments. Context-aware systems are designed to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Understand dynamic environments:} Incorporate real-time data to adjust workflows and outputs.
    \item \textbf{Bridge data to decisions:} Translate raw data into actionable insights without extensive manual intervention.
    \item \textbf{Adapt to evolving scenarios:} Adjust to unforeseen conditions or emerging trends.
\end{itemize}

While these systems represent a significant step forward, they still face challenges. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supply Chain Management:} Traditional tools track inventory but fail to predict disruptions caused by external factors such as weather events or geopolitical risks.
    \item \textbf{Healthcare:} Scheduling systems can manage appointments but lack the capability to prioritize critical patients based on real-time health data.
\end{itemize}

These examples highlight the limitations of context-aware systems in achieving comprehensive decision-making. While they offer adaptability, they are constrained by their dependence on predefined rules and lack the ability to process unstructured data or make advanced contextual decisions.

\section{The Rise of Vertical AI Agent Solutions}

As industries face increasingly complex and domain-specific challenges, the limitations of traditional and context-aware systems have become evident. Vertical AI agents have emerged as a transformative solution, embedding industry-specific expertise and fine-tuned intelligence into adaptable, real-time systems. By combining the flexibility of context-aware systems with domain knowledge, they empower organizations to address unique challenges with precision and efficiency.

These agents bridge the gap between general-purpose systems and the specific demands of modern industries, enabling real-time adaptability and specialized problem-solving. This evolution marks a pivotal shift in intelligent system design, allowing businesses to optimize workflows, enhance decision-making, and tackle increasingly dynamic operational requirements with unprecedented effectiveness.

\subsection{Operational Advantages of Vertical AI Agents}

\end{itemize}

Vertical Ai agent solutions are rapidly gaining momentum, with major players such as Google, AWS, OpenAI, and Microsoft spearheading efforts to develop platforms that simplify and scale the creation of vertical AI solutions. While these advancements signal a transformative shift, we are still in the early stages of this journey, with operational patterns only beginning to take shape. These emerging platforms aim to provide standardized frameworks for fine-tuning, deployment, and integration, enabling a more structured approach to building intelligent, adaptive agents. In \textbf{Section 3}, we explore \textbf{LLM agents}, the bedrock of vertical AI agents, leveraging large language models for domain-specific intelligence and adaptability. \textbf{Section 4} introduces \textbf{agentic systems}, their categories, operational patterns, and transformative industry applications.


\section{What Are LLM Agents?}
\subsection{Definition}
LLM agents are autonomous, intelligent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that integrate modular components—reasoning, memory, cognitive skills, and tools—to solve complex tasks in dynamic and evolving environments. These agents are designed to operate independently, adapt to changes, and execute sophisticated tasks by combining domain-specific expertise with contextual understanding. 
Each module within the agent's architecture serves a distinct purpose: reasoning enables logical decision-making, memory supports retention and recall of critical information, and tools facilitate interaction with external systems and environments. Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the modular architecture and components of an LLM agent, highlighting its ability to perform dynamic, real-time processes with adaptability, intelligence, and precision.

We introduce a new module to the core building blocks of the LLM agent—\textbf{cognitive skills}—which fills the gap between pre-trained or fine-tuned LLM reasoning, external tools for interacting with the environment, and new inference models. This module ensures that LLM agents are equipped with purpose-built models tailored to specific tasks, enhancing their ability to operate effectively across various domains and challenges.

\subsection{LLM Agents vs. LLM Workflows}
It is important to distinguish LLM agents from LLM workflows, as they differ both conceptually and operationally. LLM workflows are predefined, static processes designed to perform specific, linear tasks. They operate based on a structured pipeline where each step is explicitly defined and executed in sequence, with little to no flexibility or adaptability.

For instance, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}, a typical workflow involves a chain of prompts using multiple LLMs, combined with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern for accessing domain-specific knowledge. In this setup, one LLM might process the query to determine intent or refine context, while another LLM, equipped with retrieved knowledge, generates the final response. The workflow’s reliance on fixed steps ensures consistency but limits flexibility. For more details on RAG implementation and advanced prompting guidelines, refer to \cite{giray2023prompt} and \cite{gao2023retrieval}.

LLM agents stand apart due to their ability to reason, adapt, and refine their actions in response to changing environments and complex goals, making them well-suited for advanced, dynamic applications. This distinction underscores the versatility and intelligence that define LLM agents as compared to traditional LLM workflows.

\end{figure}

\newpage
\subsection{Core Modules of LLM Agents}

\subsubsection{Memory: The Core of Continuity and Context}
The memory module underpins the agent’s ability to maintain context across interactions, ensuring personalized and consistent responses. It stores historical interactions, user preferences, and domain-specific knowledge, serving as the agent’s long-term storage system. By leveraging memory, the agent achieves:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Contextual Awareness:} Drawing on prior interactions to maintain continuity.
    \item \textbf{Personalization:} Adapting responses based on user-specific information.
    \item \textbf{Domain Expertise:} Utilizing stored knowledge to deliver precise and informed outputs.
\end{itemize}
This module ensures that the agent operates seamlessly, integrating past interactions with real-time data to provide contextually appropriate results.

\subsubsection{Reasoning Engine (LLM): The Brain of the Agent}
The Reasoning Engine module, powered by the LLM, is the decision-making core of an LLM agent. It orchestrates logical inference, planning, contextual understanding, and personalized interaction, transforming raw data into actionable insights. By integrating inputs from Memory, Cognitive Skills, and Tools, the Reasoning Engine ensures the agent operates effectively in dynamic and complex environments. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:architecture}, this module lies at the heart of agentic intelligence, driving coherence and adaptability in every interaction.

\paragraph{Core Capabilities of the Reasoning Engine}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Logical Inference and Problem-Solving:} The Reasoning Engine evaluates inputs to derive meaningful conclusions. By analyzing ambiguous or complex scenarios, it applies advanced logical reasoning to ensure the agent’s responses are precise and data-driven.
    \item \textbf{Contextual Understanding and Response Generation:} Leveraging historical data from Memory and real-time inputs from Tools, the Reasoning Engine tailors outputs to the context, ensuring coherent, adaptive, and aligned interactions. This contextual understanding enables the agent to handle diverse and evolving scenarios with accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Task Sequencing, Goal-Oriented Planning, and Chain of Thought Reasoning:} The Reasoning Engine strategically organizes and sequences tasks, ensuring goal-oriented behavior. A key enhancement is its Chain of Thought Reasoning, which allows the agent to break down complex queries into smaller, sequential steps. This process ensures clarity, logical flow, and accurate resolution, especially for multifaceted tasks.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Personas for Tailored Interactions:} The Reasoning Engine integrates personas to adapt the agent’s tone, style, and reasoning approach based on its audience. Personas enhance user trust and engagement by aligning interactions with expectations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Empathetic Persona:} Suitable for healthcare or customer support, offering compassionate and understanding interactions.
        \item \textbf{Professional Persona:} For business or legal applications, ensuring formal and precise responses.
        \item \textbf{Casual Persona:} For consumer-facing roles, promoting friendly and approachable communication.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Cognitive Skills: Task-Specific Inferences}

The Cognitive Skills module acts as a \textbf{model hub}, equipping the agent with purpose-built models specifically designed to accomplish tasks that general-purpose LLMs, even when fine-tuned LLMs, struggle to perform effectively. Fine-tuned models often lack the precision and specialization required for complex, domain-specific tasks. The Cognitive Skills module bridges this gap by delivering domain-specific cognitive capabilities uniquely tailored for specialized applications, enhancing the agent’s functionality and adaptability. By leveraging these specialized skills, the agent can tackle tasks requiring high precision, domain expertise, or advanced processing capabilities.

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


These cognitive skills enable the agent to function as a \textbf{versatile, purpose-driven system} that adapts to its operational environment by leveraging specialized capabilities. By acting as a \textbf{bridge between the LLM’s general reasoning abilities and domain-specific inference tasks}, this module ensures that the agent is not only adaptable but also precise, reliable, and aligned with industry-specific needs.



\subsubsection{Tools: Bridging Knowledge and Interaction}
The Tools module equips the agent with a range of tools that enhance its ability to be contextually and environmentally aware. These tools enable the agent to access, retrieve, and process information from various sources, ensuring its actions are informed, adaptive, and aligned with operational goals. Examples of tools the agent can leverage include:

\end{itemize}
Together, these industry innovations and academic advancements are driving the rapid evolution of agentic systems, paving the way for more versatile and impactful AI solutions.

\newpage
\subsection{Categories of Agentic Systems}
Agentic systems can be categorized into three primary types based on their structure, scope, and interaction dynamics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Task-Specific Agents}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Agent Systems}
    \item \textbf{Human-Augmented Agents}
\end{enumerate}
Each category reflects a unique approach to designing intelligent systems, tailored to address different operational needs and complexities.

\subsubsection{Task-Specific Agent}
\paragraph{Definition:}
A Task-Specific Agent is an autonomous system designed to handle a specific function or solve a narrowly defined problem within a particular domain. These agents act as specialized modules that contribute to larger systems by efficiently managing discrete tasks.

There are various patterns to implement Task-Specific Agents based on application needs. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ReAct Agent:} Combines reasoning and action to handle interactive workflows and decision-making tasks \cite{ReAct2022}.
    \item \textbf{Router Agent:} Maps queries or tasks to the appropriate sub-agents or data sources, often used in multi-domain retrieval systems like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) \cite{SRSA2024}.
\end{itemize}

In the next section, we will explore the architectural principles and use cases of the RAG Agent Router, a common implementation of the Router Agent pattern.

\newpage
\paragraph{RAG Agent Router :}

is a Task-Specific Agent designed to dynamically orchestrate knowledge retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems. Its primary function is to analyze user queries and map them to the appropriate domain-specific knowledge sources, tools, or APIs, ensuring efficient and contextually accurate responses.

Figure \ref{fig:rag_router} illustrates the architecture of the RAG Agent Router. When a user submits a query, it is processed by the LLM Agent (Router), which determines the appropriate route based on the query's intent. The router maps the query to one of two distinct vector databases, each representing a specific knowledge domain (e.g., legal knowledge or financial data). These vector databases are powered by domain-specific encoders, fine-tuned to understand the semantics and key aspects of their respective domains. The relevant contextual information retrieved is combined with a prompt template and sent to the LLM, which generates a summarized and contextually accurate response. The response is then delivered back to the user, ensuring relevance and precision tailored to the query.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder3.png}
    \caption{Architecture of the RAG Agent Router with Domain-Specific Vector Databases}
    \label{fig:rag_router}
\end{figure}

This pattern is particularly valuable in scenarios such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Domain-Specific Knowledge Sources:} Where multiple vector databases are tailored to specific domains (e.g., legal, financial) and rely on fine-tuned encoders to understand the semantics and nuances of their respective fields.
    \item \textbf{Separation of Indexes:} When combining knowledge sources into a single index is impractical due to constraints like scalability, performance optimization, or security requirements.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Query Handling:} When user queries vary in intent and context, requiring the router to apply specialized retrieval strategies to deliver accurate, domain-specific information.
    \item \textbf{Leveraging Different Tools or APIs:} When queries necessitate the use of specific external tools (e.g., calculators, data analysis APIs, or CRM integrations) to supplement retrieval with actionable insights or automated workflows.
\end{itemize}


\newpage
\paragraph{Practical Use Cases of the Router Agent}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Customer Support Systems}
 \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scenario:} A customer submits multiple queries spanning different domains, such as tracking shipments, processing returns, and requesting refunds.
    \item \textbf{Solution:} The Router Agent parses the intent of each query, maps them to the respective domain-specific knowledge or APIs (e.g., tracking database, returns system, payments database, customer relationship management (CRM) tools, inventory management systems, or live chat platforms), retrieves the necessary data, and aggregates the information into a cohesive response for the customer.
\end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enterprise Knowledge Management}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scenario:} Employees need access to documents stored across multiple departmental databases, such as HR policies, legal precedents, and financial reports.
        \item \textbf{Solution:} The Router Agent identifies the domain of the employee’s query and routes it to the appropriate database. It retrieves the relevant document or data and presents it efficiently, ensuring fast and accurate access to information.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Healthcare Decision Support}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scenario:} A physician queries multiple systems to access patient history, lab results, and clinical guidelines for a specific medical condition.
        \item \textbf{Solution:} The Router Agent processes the query and maps it to the respective systems (e.g., electronic health records, diagnostic databases, and treatment guidelines). It retrieves the relevant information and integrates it into a single, comprehensive report for the physician.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RAG Agent Router in Multi-Domain Retrieval}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scenario:} A system with separate vector databases for legal, financial, and technical knowledge needs to process a user query such as: "Summarize recent IP law precedents in technology."
        \item \textbf{Solution:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The Router Agent identifies the domain as "legal."
            \item It maps the query to the "Legal Precedents Database."
            \item It retrieves summaries of relevant cases and passes them to the LLM, which generates a concise and domain-accurate response tailored to the query.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\subsubsection{Multi-Agent Systems}
\paragraph{Definition:}
A Multi-Agent System is a collection of autonomous agents designed to collaborate and solve interconnected problems or achieve shared goals. These systems act as distributed modules that work together by communicating and coordinating tasks, offering scalability and adaptability in complex workflows. Depending on the application, agents within the system may share a common memory or operate with separate, isolated memories to optimize task execution.

There are various patterns to implement Multi-Agent Systems based on application needs. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Orchestrated Multi-Agent System:} Involves a lead agent that delegates subtasks to specialized agents and integrates their outputs, commonly used in dynamic, multi-step workflows.
    \item \textbf{RAG Orchestrated Multi-Agent System:} Extends the orchestrated system by incorporating agents specialized in retrieval tasks, with each agent accessing a specific knowledge domain or tool. The lead agent dynamically routes queries to the relevant agents and integrates the retrieved information to ensure accurate and context-aware responses.
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Problem Solvers:} Agents communicate directly with one another to achieve shared objectives without central control. This pattern is suitable for decentralized or distributed tasks where agents share information to collectively solve problems.
\end{itemize}

In the next section, we will explore the architectural principles and use cases of the RAG Orchestrated Multi-Agent System, a common implementation of this pattern.

\newpage

\paragraph{RAG Orchestrated Multi-Agent System:}
is an advanced implementation of a Multi-Agent System where a lead agent coordinates the activities of multiple specialized agents, each focused on retrieval tasks from specific knowledge domains or tools. The lead agent acts as the central orchestrator, dynamically routing queries to the relevant retrieval agents, collecting their outputs, and integrating the information into a unified, context-aware response. This design ensures efficient handling of complex queries that require information from diverse, domain-specific sources. 

Figure \ref{fig:multi_agent_system} illustrates an example of a responsible RAG Orchestrated Multi-Agent System. When a user submits a query, it is first received by the LLM Agent (Orchestrator), which parses the query and determines how to decompose it into subtasks based on the query's intent. Each subtask is dynamically assigned to one of the specialized LLM Agents, which are responsible for interacting with distinct tools or cognitive skills.

This example highlights a specific architecture pattern for such a system, but additional agents can be integrated based on the application's requirements, providing flexibility for domain-specific or task-specific enhancements.

The specialized LLM Agents are connected to tools and cognitive skills, categorized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tools:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Domain-Specific Sources:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{LLM Agent 1:} Connected to \textbf{Vector Search Engines}, which access specific vector databases (e.g., DB1, DB2, DB3). These databases represent unique knowledge domains, such as legal, financial, or technical data.
            \item \textbf{LLM Agent 2:} Connected to \textbf{Knowledge Graphs}, which provide structured and interconnected data for handling complex, interlinked queries.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Broad Contextual Sources:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{LLM Agent 3:} Connected to \textbf{Search APIs}, leveraging external search engines or APIs to retrieve supplementary information and broader contextual data.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\newpage
    \item \textbf{Cognitive Skills:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{LLM Agent 4:} Utilizes \textbf{Guardrail Classifiers} to assess the risk levels of decisions made by the Orchestrator and other agents. These classifiers are pre-built to identify vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, and potential risks, ensuring that all outputs adhere to safety and responsibility guidelines.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each LLM Agent retrieves the necessary information from its assigned tool or skill, ensuring relevance and domain accuracy. The Orchestrator integrates the outputs from all agents, incorporating the risk assessment and validation performed by \textbf{LLM Agent 4}. The compiled context, along with the Orchestrator’s final decision, is then sent to the LLM, which processes this input to generate the final response. This response is delivered back to the user, ensuring it is cohesive, contextually accurate, and ethically sound.

\subsubsection{Human-Augmented Agent}
A Human-Augmented Agent is an intelligent system designed to collaborate with humans by automating complex tasks while incorporating human oversight, feedback, or decision-making. These agents function as adaptive modules in larger systems, augmenting human capabilities by providing insights, generating recommendations, and performing tasks autonomously within predefined boundaries.

There are various patterns to implement Human-Augmented Agents based on application needs. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Agent:} Integrates human feedback on decision status and environmental context to validate, refine, or override outputs generated by the agent.
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Agent:} Operates interactively with humans in real time, providing iterative suggestions or assisting in task execution.
    \item \textbf{Supervisory Agent:} Monitors processes, flags anomalies, and recommends corrective actions for human validation and intervention.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{placeholder5.png}
    \caption{Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Agent Pattern for Collaborative Decision-Making}
    \label{fig:hitl_agent}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hitl_agent} illustrates the architecture of a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Agent Pattern, where the agent operates autonomously to process queries while integrating human expertise for validation and refinement.

\newpage
\paragraph{Key Components of the HITL Agent Workflow Pattern}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Query Input:} A user submits a query that is routed to the HITL Agent for processing.
    \item \textbf{Domain Knowledge Retrieval:} The HITL Agent uses a Vector Search mechanism to retrieve relevant information from a Vector Database, which contains domain-specific knowledge.
    \item \textbf{Response Generation:} Based on the retrieved information, the HITL Agent generates a preliminary response or decision.
    \item \textbf{Human Feedback:} The Human Expert reviews the agent's output, providing feedback on the decision status (e.g., approve, reject, modify) and offering additional contextual inputs if needed.
    \item \textbf{Feedback Loop:} The feedback from the human expert is integrated into the HITL Agent's reasoning process, allowing the agent to refine its understanding and improve future outputs.
    \item \textbf{Final Response:} Once validated or refined, the final response is delivered to the user.
\end{enumerate}

This pattern ensures that the agent operates autonomously within its domain but relies on human expertise to address high-stakes or context-sensitive decisions, enhancing reliability and adaptability. The feedback loop also enables the HITL Agent to learn and evolve based on human interactions, ensuring continuous improvement over time.
