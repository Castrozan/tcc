Proposed Action Plan to Refine the PowerPoint Presentation  
==========================================================

I will follow the structure of our earlier review sections.  
For each, you will see: (A) goal, (B) concrete actions, (C) expected deliverables, and (D) owner / tool we’ll use.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Section III – Guideline Gap Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Bullet Grammar & Brevity  
   A. Goal  All sub-bullets end with semicolon; last ends with period; ≤ 15 words.  
   B. Action  Run pass on each slide, rewriting long bullets & correcting punctuation.  
   C. Deliverable  Cleaned markdown for `presentation.md`.  
   D. Owner  Me (code edit) after plan approval.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Section V – Speech Script & Timing
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Word Count Pass  
   • Target ≤ 110 words/slide overall; key slides 40-60 words.  
   • Remove verbal citation details; keep names/dates on slides visually.

2. Narrative Hooks  
   • Add quick transitions (“Agora vejamos…”) to keep pace.  
   • Highlight “take-away” phrase per slide for emphasis.

3. Rehearsal Checklist  
   • Insert approximate speaking time in presenter notes.  
   • Plan two timed dry-runs; adjust pacing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Section VI – Next-Step Checklist Implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Restructure markdown file (`presentation.md`) per new outline.  
2. Execute bullet clean-up & punctuation standardisation.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sequence & Timeline
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 – Approve this action plan.  
Step 2 – I update slide outline & markdown structure (no deep content yet).  
Step 3 – Ask for review.
Step 4 – I perform content edits, bullet shortening, table merges, reference formatting.  
Step 5 – Ask for review.
Step 6 – Final polishing, rehearsal metrics.

# **Implementation Plan for Presentation Optimization**

## **Priority 1: Slide Consolidation (Critical)**

### **WHAT:** Reduce development/analysis section from 9 slides (slides 9-17) to 8 slides maximum

### **WHY:** 
- Guidelines explicitly state "Do not exceed 8 slides" for development/analysis section
- Current structure violates academic presentation standards
- Risk of time overrun and evaluator penalties
- Better focus on key contributions vs. excessive detail

### **HOW:**
**Option A - Merge Architecture & System Overview:**
- Combine Slide 9 (Arquitetura Geral) + Slide 13 (Demonstração do Sistema)
- Create unified "System Architecture & Live Demonstration" slide

**Option C - Streamline Technical Components:**
- Merge Slides 10-12 (Generator, Client, Interface) into 2 slides
- Focus on core functionality rather than detailed technical implementation
- Emphasize outcomes over process details

---

## **Priority 2: Content Rebalancing (High)**

### **WHAT:** Optimize content distribution and technical depth across slides

### **WHY:**
- Current slides vary significantly in content density
- Some slides are text-heavy while others are image-focused
- Need consistent information hierarchy for smooth presentation flow
- Balance technical rigor with audience accessibility

### **HOW:**
**Phase 1 - Content Audit:**
- Map current speech script timing per slide
- Identify slides exceeding 1-2 minutes of content
- Mark redundant information across multiple slides

**Phase 2 - Content Redistribution:**
- Move detailed technical explanations to appendix/backup slides
- Strengthen practical implications and contributions
- Ensure each slide has clear single focus

**Phase 3 - Visual-Text Balance:**
- Enhance text-heavy slides with supporting visuals
- Add context annotations to technical diagrams
- Create consistent slide template structure

---

## **Priority 3: Time Management Optimization (High)**

### **WHAT:** Ensure strict 20-minute presentation compliance with buffer time

### **WHY:**
- Guidelines warn about time limit penalties
- Current detailed speech scripts may exceed time limits
- Need buffer for spontaneous explanations and transitions
- Professional presentation requires precise timing

### **HOW:**
**Timing Analysis:**
- Calculate current total speech script duration
- Map slide-by-time breakdown (target: 18 minutes content + 2 minutes buffer)
- Identify longest slides for reduction priority

**Script Optimization:**
- Reduce repetitive explanations across slides
- Eliminate non-essential technical details in speech
- Create concise transition phrases between sections
- Mark optional content for flexible timing

**Practice Protocol:**
- Record full presentation runs with timing
- Test with Q&A simulation
- Create timing checkpoints (5-minute, 10-minute, 15-minute marks)

---

## **Priority 4: Technical Accessibility (Medium)**

### **WHAT:** Balance technical depth with broad academic audience comprehension

### **WHY:**
- Evaluation panel may include non-technical professors
- Complex technical jargon can obscure key contributions
- Need to demonstrate research significance beyond technical implementation
- Academic presentations require broader impact articulation

### **HOW:**
**Language Simplification:**
- Replace complex technical terms with accessible explanations
- Add brief context for specialized terminology (OpenAPI, MCP, LLM)
- Use analogies for complex concepts

**Impact Emphasis:**
- Lead technical slides with practical implications
- Connect technical achievements to democratization goals
- Quantify benefits in user-centric terms

**Visual Communication:**
- Enhance technical diagrams with explanatory annotations
- Use color coding for information hierarchy
- Create visual summaries of complex processes

---

## **Priority 5: Backup Preparation (Medium)**

### **WHAT:** Develop comprehensive backup materials and contingency plans

### **WHY:**
- Technical demonstrations can fail during live presentations
- Deep technical questions may require detailed explanations
- Preparation demonstrates professionalism and thorough research understanding

### **HOW:**
**Technical Backup:**
- Create static screenshots of all live demonstration steps
- Prepare detailed technical appendix slides
- Record backup video demonstration

**Q&A Preparation:**
- Anticipate questions about MCP protocol specifics
- Prepare explanations for implementation choices
- Develop responses for limitation and future work queries

**Contingency Planning:**
- Test presentation on multiple systems/projectors
- Prepare offline versions of all materials
- Create simplified emergency presentation version

---

## **Implementation Timeline**

**Week 1:** Content consolidation and slide reduction
**Week 2:** Timing optimization and script refinement  
**Week 3:** Technical accessibility improvements and visual enhancements
**Week 4:** Backup preparation and full presentation practice runs

## **Success Metrics**

- ✅ Maximum 8 slides in development/analysis section
- ✅ 18-minute presentation duration (2-minute buffer)
- ✅ Clear technical explanations accessible to non-specialists
- ✅ Smooth transitions between all sections
- ✅ Complete backup materials prepared

This plan prioritizes compliance with academic guidelines while maintaining the technical rigor and scientific contribution quality of your research.
