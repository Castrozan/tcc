Here’s a clear, step-by-step plan for implementing the **dummy todo app** application, focusing on **users, teams, and tasks**. This plan ensures the app is ready for all three integration approaches (ORM, OpenAPI/Swagger, direct DB).

---

## 1. **Define the Data Model**

### Entities:
- **User**
  - id (PK)
  - name
  - email
  - password_hash (for realism, even if not used)
- **Team**
  - id (PK)
  - name
  - description
- **Task**
  - id (PK)
  - title
  - description
  - status (e.g., todo, in_progress, done)
  - due_date
  - team_id (FK to Team)
  - assigned_user_id (FK to User, nullable)

### Relationships:
- A **Team** has many **Users** (many-to-many)
- A **User** can belong to many **Teams** (many-to-many)
- A **Team** has many **Tasks**
- A **Task** can be assigned to a **User** (optional)

#### Join Table:
- **TeamUser**
  - user_id (FK)
  - team_id (FK)

---

## 2. **Set Up the Project Structure**

- `/models` — Sequelize models for User, Team, Task, TeamUser
- `/routes` — Express routes for API endpoints
- `/controllers` — Business logic for each resource
- `/config` — Database config, Sequelize setup
- `/swagger` — OpenAPI spec (YAML or JSON)
- `/db` — SQL scripts for schema (for direct DB access)
- `/app.js` or `/server.js` — Main entry point

---

## 3. **Implement the Backend**

### a. **PostgreSQL**
- Create the database and tables (matching the model above).

### b. **Sequelize ORM**
- Define models and relationships.
- Sync models to the database.

### c. **Express API**
- CRUD endpoints for User, Team, Task.
- Endpoints for:
  - Adding/removing users to/from teams.
  - Assigning tasks to users.
  - Listing tasks by team, by user, by status.

### d. **Swagger/OpenAPI**
- Document all endpoints.
- Include schemas for request/response bodies.
- Add authentication placeholder (even if not implemented).

### e. **Direct DB Access**
- Provide a module for running raw SQL queries (for analytics, e.g., “tasks due this week”).

---

## 4. **Prepare for Integration Approaches**

- **ORM Approach:** All business logic via Sequelize.
- **OpenAPI/MCP Approach:** All business logic via REST API, fully documented in Swagger.
- **Direct DB Approach:** Expose a way to run raw SQL queries (with validation/sanitization).

---

## 5. **Testing & Dummy Data**

- Seed the database with:
  - 2–3 teams
  - 4–5 users (some in multiple teams)
  - 6–10 tasks (various statuses, some assigned, some unassigned)
- Write basic tests for endpoints and DB queries.

---

## 6. **Frontend (Optional for Now)**
- Minimal React app with:
  - Login (optional)
  - List teams, users, tasks
  - Create/edit tasks
  - Assign users to teams/tasks

---

## 7. **Documentation**
- README with setup instructions.
- Example API calls.
- Example SQL queries for direct DB access.
