Perfect — I read through all three materials and here’s a full breakdown for your **ECC pitch** and a **detailed 5-minute roteiro (script)** following the structure from the examples and your project’s documentation.

---

## 🧩 **Your Project Summary (from Entregas ECC)**

**Theme:** Conversational AI Integration Platform
**Problem:**
Companies already have REST APIs but face long and complex integration cycles when adding conversational AI. Each system integration can take months, resulting in fragmented user experiences.

**Solution:**
A platform that automatically converts REST API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger) into conversational interfaces — intelligent agents that let users interact with systems naturally, through chat.

**Public Target:**
CTOs, software architects, and product managers in medium-to-large companies that want to adopt AI faster without complex development.

**Differential:**

* Automates creation of conversational agents directly from API specs.
* Low-code/no-code integration.
* Focused on startups and mid-sized tech companies.
* Lower cost vs. big global players.
* Privacy-compliant (LGPD).

**Market:**

* TAM ≈ US$ 10 bi (global)
* SAM ≈ US$ 800 mi (LatAm)
* SOM ≈ US$ 0.5 mi (Brazil, short term)

**Competitors:**
Botpress, Dialogflow, Power Virtual Agents, Rasa, Zapier.
**Your edge:** automation, simplicity, price, local compliance.

**Business Model:**
B2B SaaS — monthly license (R$ 1.500 – 3.000 / month), possible freemium or pilot entry.

## 🎬 **Pitch Flow (5 min / up to 10 slides)**

Based on *Aula_Pitch_Certo*  and *Exemplo_CC_Business* .

### 🔹 Slide 1 — Elevator Ride (0 – 0:30)

> Hook + Problem + Impact

**Script:**

> “Imagine your company has ten different systems — CRM, ERP, support, billing — all with APIs.
> But every time you want to connect them with AI, it takes months of development, tons of testing, and each system speaks a different language.
> The result? Fragmented experiences, lost productivity, and delayed innovation.
> We’re here to fix that.”

---

### 🔹 Slide 2 — The Problem (0:30 – 1:00)

Show who suffers, evidence from validation (ECC doc stage 1 ).

**Script:**

> “Our research with over 15 companies and 7 CTOs confirmed:
> even with well-documented APIs, integrating them with conversational AI takes 2–3 months per system.
> 90 % say they lack internal expertise and tools to do it efficiently.”

Visual: short graph/bar showing time vs integration difficulty.

---

### 🔹 Slide 3 — The Solution (1:00 – 1:30)

> Product + How it works + Demo snippet

**Script:**

> “We created a platform that reads an API spec (OpenAPI) and automatically generates a conversational agent.
> In minutes, that API can be accessed by natural language — no coding, no custom infrastructure.
> Let’s look at the demo.”
> *(insert short 10 s clip or screen showing the MVP from your Google Drive link)*

---

### 🔹 Slide 4 — The Market (1:30 – 2:00)

Show TAM / SAM / SOM from Entregas ECC .

**Script:**

> “Conversational AI will surpass US$ 32 billion globally by 2030.
> Our intersection — conversational AI + API management — represents ~ US$ 10 billion TAM.
> In Latin America, about US$ 800 million, and in Brazil alone, we can reach ~ US$ 0.5 million per year in the first phase.”

Visual: concentric TAM / SAM / SOM circles.

---

### 🔹 Slide 5 — The Business Model (2:00 – 2:30)

Show revenue strategy (B2B subscription + pilot).

**Script:**

> “Our model is B2B SaaS — companies pay a monthly subscription, from R$ 1.500 to R$ 3.000 per license.
> We’ll begin with pilot programs and a freemium tier to accelerate adoption.
> Our ROI comes from reducing integration time from months to hours.”

Visual: small recurring-revenue diagram.

---

### 🔹 Slide 6 — The Competition (2:30 – 3:00)

Show differentiation matrix.

**Script:**

> “There are great tools like Dialogflow and Power Virtual Agents,
> but they need heavy manual setup and target large enterprises.
> We’re different: automation from OpenAPI → chat agent in one click,
> lower cost, and LGPD-compliant hosting in Brazil.”

Visual: table with checkmarks for features.

---

### 🔹 Slide 7 — Target User (3:00 – 3:30)

> Show persona and acquisition plan.

**Script:**

> “Our initial users are CTOs and software architects in SaaS startups and mid-sized tech companies.
> We’ll reach them through LinkedIn tech communities and local events in Santa Catarina and São Paulo.
> Marketing strategy: pilot partnerships + content marketing showing real time savings.”

---

### 🔹 Slide 8 — Technology (3:30 – 4:00)

Optional but valuable given your audience.

**Script:**

> “The platform is built with a microservice architecture — a backend in Go and Python for agent generation and an API orchestrator to consume OpenAPI specifications.
> It uses GPT-based models for conversation flow and secure access management for enterprise data.”

---

### 🔹 Slide 9 — Team (4:00 – 4:30)

> Introduce yourselves + roles.

**Script:**

> “Our team combines expertise in backend architecture and AI:
> Bruno Boger – backend lead; Douglas Kuerten – integration specialist;
> Lucas Zanoni – AI and platform architecture;
> Joel Francisco – frontend and UX; Vinicius Milanez – infrastructure and deployment.
> Together we built and tested the MVP you just saw.”

---

### 🔹 Slide 10 — Future and Call to Action (4:30 – 5:00)

> Vision + Next steps + Closing.

**Script:**

> “Our next goal is to launch a beta with three regional partners and scale to Latin America in 2026.
> We aim to make API integration as simple as talking to an assistant.
> If you believe in a future where every system can be accessed by conversation — join us to build it.”

## 🧭 Tips for Your Delivery

* Keep ≈ 30 seconds per slide.
* Use one speaker (you or a chosen representative).
* Start strong and end with a clear vision of impact.
* Use the MVP demo as a hook — visual proof sells better than concepts.
* Avoid reading slides verbatim — tell a story.
