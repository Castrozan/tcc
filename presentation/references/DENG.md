Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the rapid growth and evolution of the Web. Today, people can perform a multitude of tasks through the use of a single browser. Despite the immense power and capabilities of the Web, its increasing complexity and the overwhelming amount of information pose significant challenges for users to easily access the information they need and achieve their goals. Especially for those who are less technologically proficient or have disabilities. In this work, we propose to tackle this issue by building a general natural language interface for the Web, which enables users to express their needs in natural language and have the system carry out the arduous actions. We examine the key components crucial for building the natural language interface. On top of that, we present our ongoing efforts in curating a new benchmark dataset covering a diverse range of websites and tasks, and establishing baselines to demonstrate the feasibility of building such a system.
